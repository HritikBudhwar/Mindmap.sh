# Mindmap.sh

## Project Summary

Mindmap.sh is a collaborative mind-mapping web application that lets users create, edit, and share interactive mind maps. The project includes a frontend built with React and a Node/Express backend with MongoDB for persistence.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, react-router-dom, react-bootstrap
- Backend: Node.js, Express, Mongoose
- File uploads: Multer
- UI libraries: lucide-react, mdb-react-ui-kit

## Key Highlights (Recruiter-friendly)
- Built a responsive React UI with reusable components and a custom mind-map visualization.
- Implemented RESTful APIs with Express and data persistence with MongoDB (Mongoose).
- Handled file uploads and user profile data; included authentication-ready patterns.
- Organized project into `frontend` and `backend` areas for clear separation of concerns.

## Setup & Quick Start
Prerequisites: Node.js (>=18) and npm

1. Install root dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. Install backend dependencies and start backend (from `backend` folder):

```
cd backend
npm install
npm run devStart
```

3. Start the frontend (from `firstmm` folder):

```
cd firstmm
npm install
npm run dev
```

## What to Look For in the Code
- Frontend components: see `firstmm/src` for `MindMap.jsx`, node components, and UI components.
- Backend APIs: see `backend/server.js` and schema definitions like `MindMapSchema.js`.

If you'd like, I can prepare a demo script, add CI, or containerize the app with Docker.
